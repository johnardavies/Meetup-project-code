We run a range of different events such as walks picnics and RPG nights. We attend festivals go to the theatre the cinema and art galleries as well as organising the occasional pub social. We even have the odd trip to the seaside.  Many of our members are native to London and know the scene well. Many of our members are also new to London. We have young members old members and plenty of people who just enjoy being goth. Everyone gets out of the group what they put into it. We advertise other goth events and operate a discount scheme in conjunction with clubs and promoters to help support the existing goth scene in London. We are explicitly inclusive of anyone who falls under the broad banner of gothdom regardless of gender sexuality nationality ethnic origin disability faith or any other traditionally divisive factors. <span style=""font-size : small""><strong><span style=""font-size : small""><span style=""text-decoration : underline"">What are we not?</strong>If you are expecting misery moping self-pity and think the world is against you personally this is not the group for you. We are not better than you but we're not a self-help group either.<span style=""font-size : small""> Contrary to some opinions we are not a horror vampire fetish dressing up modelling photography Satanic heavy metal or architectural interest group. There are plenty of Meetup groups that are dedicated to those specific subjects so if you're primarily interested in one of those you're likely to be better catered for elsewhere. However our members and organisers have an eclectic range of personal interests which touch upon many of those topics. This means that we will occasionally go out to look at pretty buildings hold meetups at goth-friendly fetish clubs or arrange to meet for beers at a metal festival. They just aren't the primary focus of the group.  The primary focus is goth. Also fun.<span style=""text-decoration : underline""><span style=""font-size : small""><strong><span style=""font-size : small"">Still want to join?</strong><span style=""font-size : small"">Ensure that you have answered all the profile questions and that you have a proper profile picture (i.e. one you can be recognised from).

At the moment we always meet during the second week of the month and on the last Saturday of the month at two different pubs in central London. We usually have other events during the month which can include picnics cinema nights quizzes reading nights big national football matches or visits to the theatre.The meetups are fun very sociable and everyone is welcome as long as they speak a little Italian.  However this is not a meet up where you can learn italian that is not the aim of the group. You'll be amazed at how much progress you make in conversation after just a few events.  People are there mostly because they want to improve brush-up on their Italian or they are Italian. With about 40-60 people coming to the monthly events it is easy to wander around and find people of your level with whom you feel really comfortable speaking italian.The standard is advanced but if you speak a reasonable level of Italian you are welcome to come along and see if they enjoy it. People are expected to speak in Italian most of the time.This means that if you speak no Italian sadly we are not the group for you. The aim of the group is to speak Italian and if people that only speak English attend it undermines the primary goal of the group.Simply look below and then choose the event you want to see.  If you are interested enough to come along just click the appropriate button.  An automatic mail message will be sent to you whenever a new event becomes available or if ever there is a change in the event.Also if you have any suggestions for events or any comments about the group please send me an email. <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/italian-35/messages/boards/thread/10250003"">Regular members have to pay £10 (£5 if you are unemployed)</a> and  this is not optional if you wish to attend meetings.

London International Meetup is an active group which arranges several different activities most weeks. It has been established since 2003 and has one of the largest memberships. Group sizes are restricted to appropriate levels and each event will have a small meetup charge to cover the organisation costs and to ensure the quality of the events. Our regular events include: <strong>- Social evenings (usually up to 40 people)</strong> Come and meet other members. It is a friendly group and you will be welcomed by the organiser when you arrive. We try to use locations which do not have a lot of background noise. Food and drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are available. <strong>- UK day trips (usually up to 20 people)</strong> We organise day trips on most weekends usually to a location within England. We travel by public transport (train and local buses or taxis). These are social events - in most cases the group remains together throughout the day except when going to a busy festival. <strong>- Theatre shows (usually up to 10 people)</strong> See a musical or play in one of the many theatres in London. This is a cheaper and more sociable way to enjoy either West End or off-West End shows. <strong>- Walks (usually up to 20 people)</strong> There is a monthly walk on a Sunday afternoon. Usually this follows a section of one of the special walking routes (eg the London Loop the Capital Ring or the Thames Path). Lunch is usually in a pub or cafe along the route. A distance of 7-10 miles is followed at a sociable medium pace. If you reply Yes to an event please make sure that you turn up (or if necessary change your reply on the meetup website if you are unable to come). For events which involve tickets (eg day trips or theatre/concerts) usually you will be asked to give your full name and mobile phone number when you reply - please make sure that you provide these so that you can be contacted if necessary. You may be removed from the group if you do not show up for a day trip or theatre show without changing your reply or notifying the organiser.,1

We hold one or more social events every month where members get a chance to meet and speak to each other in Dutch.

For others who are learning the language there is the opportunity to listen and practise speaking in a relaxed friendly environment. There is no charge for membership nor for the monthly Meetups.<strong>FAQ:</strong>Q: I'm worried that I'm a beginner or my Dutch is rusty or won't be up to the level of the others. Should I come to the next Meetup? Will I still be able to join in?A: Certainly yes. We have people of all levels at every Meetup.

Everyone helps everyone else.&nbsp;Q: I don't speak any Dutch at all yet. Can I come to the Meetup?A: Yes. Our Dutch and Belgian members can all speak good English so you'll be fine. Plus as well as beginners in the language Dutch and Belgians regularly bring their partners and friends who just want to socialise or talk a bit about the cool culture in those countries so you won't be the only one speaking English all night. You might want to share any Dutch words and phrases you do know. ...or just enjoy a drink and chat. No pressure at all.&nbsp;,1

Then we are in big trouble! Lets ask instead:<ul>  why war?Why poverty?why oppression?why exploitation?why is life more difficult than it need be? </ul>Answers will tend to indicate that there are just a few basic problems. Are they really insoluble? The ""no""s are at worst equally balanced by ""yes we can""s.

We share our true selves gain feedback and insights and grow through experiencing others and ourselves. The goal of our work together will be to identify and transcend our limiting patterns and beliefs and to enhance our interpersonal relationships. Therefore sincere honest and authentic participation is necessary.We will be meeting once a week share ourselves and grow through feedback and insight. This is a process group that will run for 10 weeks at a time will take place in a supported environment and be facilitated.The cost of the course is £400 so please only request to join if you are serious about this experience.Although anyone can join there will be an assessment process before members can attend the group sessions.<span style=""color : #ff0000"">For more info on group and how it works please read this extract:In group therapy approximately 6-12 individuals meet face-to-face with a trained group therapist. Interaction between group members is highly encouraged and provides each person with an opportunity to try out new ways of behaving; it also provides members with an opportunity for learning more about the way they interact with others. It is a safe environment in which members work to establish a level of trust that allows them to talk personally and honestly. Group members make a commitment to the group and are instructed that the content of the group sessions are confidential.It is not appropriate for group members to disclose events of the group to an outside person. When people come into a group and interact freely with other group members they usually recreate those difficulties that brought them to group therapy in the first place. Under the direction of the group therapist the group is able to give support offer alternatives and comfort members in such a way that these difficulties become resolved.During group therapy people may begin to see that they are not alone and that there is hope and help. It has long been recognised that we can often feel awkward when viewing ourselves on videos or listening to our own voices on tape recordings. Group therapy explores this anxiety around how we appear and how we are perceived and provides an opportunity to begin to understand how we may be experienced by another person in a safe and secure setting. Of course it can just be comforting to hear that other people have had similar difficulties.Best Wishes <span style=""color : #ff0000"">Ali Asghar<span style=""color : #ff0000"">07854001326",1

If you pay something you're more likely to want to join in and get value from this - after joining up all other meetups are free (other than paying for entry to any events which is members' responsibility).<strong>How much is in the calendar is entirely down to the membership.</strong> Meetups like this thrive on everyone joining in and contributing once in a while and not just waiting for the organisers to well organise everything. If you want more variety in the calendar then come up with ideas and suggest them. Get involved and help make this a successful meetup. Why not offer to become a 'host' so you can put gig meetups in the calendar that you want to see?<strong>London is a fantastic city full of great music and friendly people - sign up and make the most of it</strong> !",1

These attitudes persist.Women were traditionally owned &amp; controlled by their fathers husbands brothers and sons and were strictly limited in what they could do excluded from education the professions government etc. and we can still see the remnants of these attitudes. Even in Britain today all women are not yet free and equal in many respects as a group they are still treated unfairly.Even now women are still expected to take on most of the role of cleaning caring catering - the domestic chores of family life work in the lowest paid jobs and do not have equal pay and pensions.Though we in Britain have been luck to have seen progress over the last 200 years or so as the society has become more secular brought about by a few reformers in every generation many of them women freethinkers there are many religious conservatives who try to prevent further progress and would gladly undo many of those reforms.We need women able to cut through the traditional preaching and stereotyping of men and women that lead to so much macho violence in society – the abuse of women and coercive sex.Women must be free to have children or not get married or not and have sex with whoever they choose under whatever circumstances they choose. And must be able to avoid unwanted pregnancy motherhood &amp; STDs - ‘God’s punishments’ for being ‘careless’ or ‘feckless’ or having sex outside of marriage not for the procreation of children. (This is why the religions are against LGBT people and same sex relationships)Women must have equal representation in government not to always be dependent upon a husband or father who is supposedly ‘responsible for her upkeep’.We need to shed the infantalising of women as dependents and 'junior' partners in society and persuade women not to collude with sexism for fear of offending conservative opinion religious beliefs and men.Sue May 2009,1

We offer walks for groups of up to twenty people which mostly:• are accessible by public transport normally by bus rides of no more than an hour from the centre of Edinburgh• start after 10 a.m. or later• are dog-friendly• end in a pub or caféThe group is non-competitive with the emphasis being on visiting beautiful and interesting places at a pace with which everybody is comfortable and meeting people and making friends.Our walks range from gentle seaside strolls of two or three miles to fairly strenuous ten-mile walks in the Pentland Hills with everything in between. Most walks include a picnic break around halfway. In addition we sometimes arrange social events such as cinema or pub evenings and Christmas or summer parties.The group is totally non-commercial but occasionally seeks to raise small amounts of money from members purely to cover the cost of using the&nbsp;<a href=""http://meetup.com/"">meetup.com</a> web site.Please note that it is your responsibility to ensure you come suitably prepared for your walk. This is especially true on hillwalks where you must have proper walking boots and clothing suitable for the changeable Scottish weather. In addition you should bring food and water and possibly a hot drink.Members come on walks at their own risk. The group has no liability insurance so members must make their own decisions about whether to go on a walk. The organiser can advise about the terrain but cannot be held responsible in the event of any mishap.Dogs are very welcome unless the details of a specific walk specify otherwise but we rely on members to keep their dogs under appropriate control. This is especially true in the hills where there may be sheep and lambs.Because many of our events are oversubscribed and have waiting lists we ask that if you sign up for an event you do in fact attend it. If you have to change your mind for any reason please don’t forget to change your status to ‘not going’ on the event’s web page. If you are unable to make an event at the last minute for whatever reason please contact the organiser of the event as soon as possible.Please read our list of <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/edinburgh-walking/pages/Frequently_asked_questions/"">frequently asked questions</a>.Although the group is informal its sheer size has necessitated the creation of a constitution. You can find it under the ‘More’ menu if you go to ‘Files’. By joining the group you are understood to have accepted the constitution so please take the time to read the one-page document.We hope to see you soon!",1

Any less-experienced members of the club accompanying this more-experienced member must be aware that they take any advice on this basis and that the onus of responsibility for deciding whether or not to rely on any such advice lies with the less-experienced member.    <strong>Venues</strong>   Organisers will provide a meeting place a time and a description of the route based on local knowledge and experience. Often a reference is made to “walk highlands” or other web sites where more detailed descriptions are available.&nbsp;Please pay particular attention to the ""Grade"" of walk C (least strenuous) to A (most difficult).<b>Donations</b>As of late 2015 it is no longer a pre-requisite that members be requested to pay for walks.

Members should adopt the policy of “self reliance”.  Medical conditions fitness level weather conditions ground conditions can all impact on members’ ability and stamina. Know your limitations!   It is important to come properly equipped and we follow the Mountaineering Council of Scotland's equipment recommendations which can be read on this link (<a href=""http://www.mcofs.org.uk/clothingandequipment.asp"">LINK CLICK HERE</a>)Climbing hill walking and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions and involvement.""    <strong>New/Inexperienced members</strong>   As a club we encourage members to participate in suitable walks. If unsure about suitability simply contact the organiser for advice.  Organisers and other experienced walkers are generally happy to assist new/inexperienced walkers when time and conditions permit but do not take this for granted.    <strong>Fun and Safety</strong>   This club is about having fun while enjoying walks. Members enjoy each others company while achieving their goals whether it is a Munro or a coastal walk. But please do not underestimate Scottish weather or conditions. If conditions deteriorate stay as a group work as a group and come home safely with a smile.<strong>Winter Walks</strong>   Walking in winter conditions is deemed to be “mountaineering”. Please read all the above again and ensure you are prepared. Winter walks can also be the most rewarding.<strong>Getting the Most  </strong> We encourage our members to join The Mountaineering Council of Scotland who provide a range of instruction for mountaineering hill walking and safety to help you get even more from your chosen mountain activity. Membership has many additional benefits.<strong>NB.

This is a group for all bookworms and avid readers whether you're into the classics romantic or gothic literature modern novels plays autobiography or travel. We now meet on the first Wednesday of every month.We select our books by an entirely democratic process.&nbsp; At any moment in time we have a 'long list' usually of between ten and twenty books. Twice a year in April and October this list is wiped clean and any member attending the meeting that month can add a book to the refreshed list if it meets our criteria (easily available either new from local bookshops or second hand online for less than £10 no more than 500 pages and preferably less not the second or later volume of a series where you need to read the earlier ones first).&nbsp; During the week before each regular monthly meeting I email the long list to those members who have visited the Meetup group online during the previous three months and ask for three votes by email.&nbsp; The five books with most votes by email are then voted on at the end of the meeting to select the book to be read two months ahead.,1

We run a range of different events such as walks picnics and RPG nights. We attend festivals go to the theatre the cinema and art galleries as well as organising the occasional pub social. We even have the odd trip to the seaside.  Many of our members are native to London and know the scene well. Many of our members are also new to London. We have young members old members and plenty of people who just enjoy being goth. Everyone gets out of the group what they put into it. We advertise other goth events and operate a discount scheme in conjunction with clubs and promoters to help support the existing goth scene in London.

However our members and organisers have an eclectic range of personal interests which touch upon many of those topics. This means that we will occasionally go out to look at pretty buildings hold meetups at goth-friendly fetish clubs or arrange to meet for beers at a metal festival. They just aren't the primary focus of the group.  The primary focus is goth.

At the moment we always meet during the second week of the month and on the last Saturday of the month at two different pubs in central London. We usually have other events during the month which can include picnics cinema nights quizzes reading nights big national football matches or visits to the theatre.The meetups are fun very sociable and everyone is welcome as long as they speak a little Italian.  However this is not a meet up where you can learn italian that is not the aim of the group. You'll be amazed at how much progress you make in conversation after just a few events.  People are there mostly because they want to improve brush-up on their Italian or they are Italian. With about 40-60 people coming to the monthly events it is easy to wander around and find people of your level with whom you feel really comfortable speaking italian.The standard is advanced but if you speak a reasonable level of Italian you are welcome to come along and see if they enjoy it. People are expected to speak in Italian most of the time.This means that if you speak no Italian sadly we are not the group for you. The aim of the group is to speak Italian and if people that only speak English attend it undermines the primary goal of the group.Simply look below and then choose the event you want to see.  If you are interested enough to come along just click the appropriate button.  An automatic mail message will be sent to you whenever a new event becomes available or if ever there is a change in the event.Also if you have any suggestions for events or any comments about the group please send me an email. <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/italian-35/messages/boards/thread/10250003"">Regular members have to pay £10 (£5 if you are unemployed)</a> and  this is not optional if you wish to attend meetings.

London International Meetup is an active group which arranges several different activities most weeks. It has been established since 2003 and has one of the largest memberships. Group sizes are restricted to appropriate levels and each event will have a small meetup charge to cover the organisation costs and to ensure the quality of the events. Our regular events include: <strong>- Social evenings (usually up to 40 people)</strong> Come and meet other members. It is a friendly group and you will be welcomed by the organiser when you arrive. We try to use locations which do not have a lot of background noise. Food and drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are available. <strong>- UK day trips (usually up to 20 people)</strong> We organise day trips on most weekends usually to a location within England. We travel by public transport (train and local buses or taxis). These are social events - in most cases the group remains together throughout the day except when going to a busy festival. <strong>- Theatre shows (usually up to 10 people)</strong> See a musical or play in one of the many theatres in London. This is a cheaper and more sociable way to enjoy either West End or off-West End shows. <strong>- Walks (usually up to 20 people)</strong> There is a monthly walk on a Sunday afternoon. Usually this follows a section of one of the special walking routes (eg the London Loop the Capital Ring or the Thames Path). Lunch is usually in a pub or cafe along the route. A distance of 7-10 miles is followed at a sociable medium pace. If you reply Yes to an event please make sure that you turn up (or if necessary change your reply on the meetup website if you are unable to come). For events which involve tickets (eg day trips or theatre/concerts) usually you will be asked to give your full name and mobile phone number when you reply - please make sure that you provide these so that you can be contacted if necessary. You may be removed from the group if you do not show up for a day trip or theatre show without changing your reply or notifying the organiser.,1

Interaction between group members is highly encouraged and provides each person with an opportunity to try out new ways of behaving; it also provides members with an opportunity for learning more about the way they interact with others. It is a safe environment in which members work to establish a level of trust that allows them to talk personally and honestly. Group members make a commitment to the group and are instructed that the content of the group sessions are confidential.It is not appropriate for group members to disclose events of the group to an outside person. When people come into a group and interact freely with other group members they usually recreate those difficulties that brought them to group therapy in the first place. Under the direction of the group therapist the group is able to give support offer alternatives and comfort members in such a way that these difficulties become resolved.During group therapy people may begin to see that they are not alone and that there is hope and help. It has long been recognised that we can often feel awkward when viewing ourselves on videos or listening to our own voices on tape recordings. Group therapy explores this anxiety around how we appear and how we are perceived and provides an opportunity to begin to understand how we may be experienced by another person in a safe and secure setting. Of course it can just be comforting to hear that other people have had similar difficulties.Best Wishes <span style=""color : #ff0000"">Ali Asghar<span style=""color : #ff0000"">07854001326",1

If you pay something you're more likely to want to join in and get value from this - after joining up all other meetups are free (other than paying for entry to any events which is members' responsibility).<strong>How much is in the calendar is entirely down to the membership.</strong> Meetups like this thrive on everyone joining in and contributing once in a while and not just waiting for the organisers to well organise everything. If you want more variety in the calendar then come up with ideas and suggest them. Get involved and help make this a successful meetup. Why not offer to become a 'host' so you can put gig meetups in the calendar that you want to see?<strong>London is a fantastic city full of great music and friendly people - sign up and make the most of it</strong> !",1
